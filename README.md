# SupplyChain

A supply chain provenance project for the CENNZnet blockchain hackathon [TestNet (NikauðŸŒ´](https://wiki.cennz.net/#/Getting-started/CENNZnet-networks), using the [CENNZnet API](https://github.com/cennznet/api.js).

## Concept  
Leveraging the use of CENNZnet's doughnuts protocol to allow governing bodies to delegate the minting of NFTs to producers.

## Install
1) clone the repo
2) `yarn`

## Setup
You can use the [CENNZnet Portal](https://cennznet.io/) to create an account. The keypair.json is downloaded to your machine when you create the account. 

Place the keypair json in the /accounts folder.

## Run it
1) in the root directory, do ```node server.js```
2) cd into the clients/ folder and run ```npm run dev```

The user guide for the CENNZnet Portal can be found [here](https://wiki.cennz.net/#/References/CENNZnet-infrastructures/Exploring-the-CENNZnet-UI).

## Output 
```
```
